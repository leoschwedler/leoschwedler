💼 Experience:

Developer Android - Foursys (Jan/2021 - Jan/2023)

I worked for Foursys, an IT consulting company that provided services for Banco Next. In Brazil, I worked for two years at Foursys, where I participated in the development of a banking application in the credit sector. My responsibilities included bug resolution, layout correction, creation of new features, and consumption of API endpoints. During my time at Banco Next, I held various roles related to native Android development, where I was able to develop skills in Java, Kotlin, Android SDK, Retrofit, SQLite, responsive interface design, and integration with RESTful services. This experience has provided me with a deep understanding of banking operations and IT practices applied in the financial sector.
